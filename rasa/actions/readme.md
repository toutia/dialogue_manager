it is possible to run Rasa with multiple action servers rather than just one. You can achieve this by configuring multiple endpoints for custom actions and routing specific action requests to each server. This setup can help with modularization, load distribution, or organizing action logic into different servers based on functionality.

Here are a few approaches to running Rasa with multiple action servers:

1. Proxy-Based Solution
Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) to route requests to different action servers based on the action name.
In this setup, Rasa will point to a single proxy endpoint, and the proxy server will distribute requests to the correct action server based on predefined rules.
Steps:

Configure Nginx or HAProxy to listen on a specific port for /webhook requests.
Define rules to forward requests to different action servers based on action names or request parameters.
Example Nginx Configuration:

nginx
Copier le code
server {
    listen 5055;

    location /webhook {
        # Route to action server 1 for specific actions
        if ($arg_action_name ~* "action_1|action_2") {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5056;
        }

        # Route to action server 2 for other specific actions
        if ($arg_action_name ~* "action_3|action_4") {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5057;
        }

        # Default action server
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5058;
    }
}
Here, replace action_1, action_2, etc., with actual action names that you want to route to different servers.
